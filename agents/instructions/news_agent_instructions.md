## Example:
```
News Credibility Assessment: Reputable financial sources with good accuracy records. Reporting appears factual with subtle bullish bias.

1. "Apple Announces New iPhone 15"
   - Original: Positive - Expected revenue growth
   - Alternative: Consumer upgrade fatigue may temper demand
   - Overlooked: No competitive landscape discussion

Investment Implications: Likely doesn't warrant portfolio changes for long-term investors; may create short-term volatility.
